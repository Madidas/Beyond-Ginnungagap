You wake up to the sound of your clock ticking.
Each ticking sound causes you to flinch in pain because of a terrible headache.
Slowly you get up and sit on the edge of your bed and look around:
Your apartment is a total mess.
You and some friends of yours have been drinking some of the booze you had gotten from Estonia.
You sigh and start muttering to yourself about how you are never going to touch that stuff again.
Once you decide to get up and get some breakfast you hear some banging on the door.
Every bang send a wave of pain into your head and you start pacing towards the door.
As you open the door you see three people standing in your doorway.
Two of them were huge and they were wearing black suits.
The third one was much shorter but still pretty intimidating
As you look at them dumbfounded one of the two large men grab you and and pins you against the wall.
As you gasp for air the short man spoke with a stereotypical russian accent:"We meet again Mr. Anderson.
And i think you know excactly why we are here. We are here to remind you that you borrowed 5000 Euros on friday.
You may not remember this happening considering the the state you were in but thats is why we are here.
We want that money back until next friday. If you don't make it...Well lets just say things won't be pleasant
The big punches you in the gut and they start walking out leaving you lying on the ground.
As you stand up you sigh deeply and mutter to yourself:"Yea...I will not that stuff again
How will things turn out? Will the money be collected in time? And if yes how will it be done?
Well...That is for you to decide.
